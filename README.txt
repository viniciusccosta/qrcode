Created based on Thonky's Tutorial (https://www.thonky.com/qr-code-tutorial/)

Made it just for fun/learning purpose.
Tried to make it the most pure (without external modules) as possible.

I'm using Python 3.7.4,
but to show QR Code it's necessary:
	matplotlib 3.1.1 (or higher?)
	numpy 1.16.4 or higher?)
and to save QR Code it's necessary:
	Pillow 6.1.0 or higher?)

PS:
	Most of the "TODO" comments are questions about things that aren't so clear on the tutorial.
